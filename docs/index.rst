dbfread - Read DBF Files with Python
====================================

Version |version|

DBF is a file format used by databases such dBase, Visual FoxPro, and
FoxBase+. This library reads DBF files and returns the data as native
Python data types for further processing. It is primarily intended for
batch jobs and one-off scripts.


.. code-block:: python

    >>> from dbfread import DBF
    >>> for record in DBF('people.dbf'):
    ...     print(record)
    {'NAME': 'Alice', 'BIRTHDATE': datetime.date(1987, 3, 1)}
    {'NAME': 'Bob', 'BIRTHDATE': datetime.date(1980, 11, 12)}
